Inspired by other PCB rulers such as the ones made by Digi-Key or Nvidia,
I decided to design one for Penn Electric Racing to use as merchandise.
I opted for a 6" design, rather than 12", for improved portability.
In addition to being merchandise, I wanted the ruler to be a useful
resource to members on the hardware team. Thus, the front of the ruler
(Altium screenshot above) contains the following references:
- copper thickness
- screw holes
- trace ampacity (for 10z Cu)
- test point size
- wire thickness
- mosfet and op-amp references
- propagation speed
- silk thickness

The back of the ruler contains common footprints and metric versions of
the throughole references from the front. It also contains the following:
- pin pitch
- RLC component power rating
- metric/mil conversions
- reference equations

The PCB was finished with black solder mask and lead-free HASL to
match Penn Electric Racing's colors. The final product is pictured below!
