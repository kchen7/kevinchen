I designed this board for an internship program at <a href="https://www.relativityspace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relativity Space</a>. It was an early revision of the low voltage battery management system for their first rocket, Terran 1. While I was lucky to be able to work on projects within the rocket itself, I unfortunately can't get into specifics as a result.
