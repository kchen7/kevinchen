## PCB Snake
<div class="side-by-side">
    <div class="toleft">
        <p> This java project was a variation of the classic game Snake, themed around a two layer PCB. The snake can travel on both the top and bottom layers, and objects must be on the same side to interact. Yes, that means the snake can cross over itself! The ICs give 1 length and increase the score by 1, while capacitors give 1 point but increase the score by 3. However, the capacitors will disappear so get them quickly!
