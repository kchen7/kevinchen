## Background
This was my very first electronics project! I worked on it with Jayden Lee in Introduction to Electrical and Systems Engineering. Flik aimed to give users a method for "Advancing Presentations with a Flik of Your Wrist." That is, it's a glove which gives users a hands-free way to control presentations just by flicking their wrist.

## The Electronics
This project contained two modules: the user module and the computer module. The user module consists of an accelerometer, an Arduino Uno and an HC-05 Bluetooth Module. This module acts as the master and communicates with the computer module over bluetooth. The computer module also contained an HC-05 Bluetooth Module, but was built with an Arduino Leonardo as it can interface with the keyboard.

We used the accelerometer to determine the threshold for advancing a slide. However, we had two problems: one flick was advancing multiple slides and random noise would also advance slides. A moving average filter was used to solve the second problem, ensuring only a series of values crossing the threshold would be considered a flick. After a flick is detected, the average has to settle below the threshold before another flick can be registered, solving the first problem.

The user module also has a pressure sensor by the thumb. When pressed, a laser diode shines, allowing Flik to be used as a laser pointer as well. Using pulse width modulation, the laser varies its brightness depending on how hard the user presses.

## Mechanical Considerations
The Arduino Uno is quite large, so the module was broken up into two. The accelerometer, laser diode, and pressure sensor were soldered onto a perf board which was then sewed into a glove the user wears. Wires run from the glove to an enclosure housing the rest of the components.

See it all in action in this short demo below!
