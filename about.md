<h2>Hi, I'm Kevin!</h2>

I'm an FPGA Verification Engineer at <a href="https://www.hudsonrivertrading.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hudson River Trading</a>. I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, with an MSE in Electrical Engineering and BSE in Computer Engineering, and was previously doing chip-level design verification of <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple</a>'s custom processors. 

While at Penn, I spent a lot of my time with [Penn Electric Racing](../Penn-Electric-Racing) (PER), where I led the hardware team in designing, reviewing, and testing our custom printed circuit boards. In the past, I've also had the opportunities to intern at
<a href="https://www.relativityspace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relativity Space</a>
 and
<a href="https://www.latch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Latch</a>.

In my free time, I love boardgames, climbing, baking, skiing, and musicals!
