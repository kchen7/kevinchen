<h2>Hi, I'm Kevin!</h2>

I'm a senior at the University of Pennsylvania, currently working towards
an MSE in Electrical Engineering and BSE in Computer Engineering.
Outside of classes, I spend most of my time with
[Penn Electric Racing](./Penn-Electric-Racing) (PER),
where I lead the hardware team in designing, reviewing, and testing our
custom printed circuit boards. My experience on PER is what sparked my
interested in electronics design.
<!-- Especially interested in insert specific stuff, fits here -->

At Penn, I've also been a TA, test writer, and peer advisor. I was a TA for
Introduction to Electrical and Systems Engineering and Head TA for Discrete Mathematics.
I write tests about circuits for *Science Olympiad at UPenn*, a national
high school competition. Finally, I enjoy guiding underclassmen through course
selection, putting together, for instance, this
[document](/assets/WhyCMPE.pdf) detailing my thoughts about
my major.

In my free time, I like origami, skiing, and watching musicals!
