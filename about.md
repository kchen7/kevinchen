<h2>Hi, I'm Kevin!</h2>

I recently graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, with an MSE in Electrical Engineering and BSE in Computer Engineering. I am currently at Apple, doing chip-level design verification of Apple's custom processors. 

In the past, I've had the amazing opportunity to intern at
<a href="https://www.relativityspace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relativity Space</a>
 and
<a href="https://www.latch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Latch</a>.
At Relativity, I moved the team closer to first flight by designing the low voltage battery management system. At Latch, I designed a USB Debugger board for the firmware team and factory test stations.

While at Penn, I spent a lot of my time with [Penn Electric Racing](../Penn-Electric-Racing) (PER), where I led the hardware team in designing, reviewing, and testing our custom printed circuit boards. It was my experience with PER that sparked my interest in electronics. In addition, I was the Head TA for Discrete Mathematics and also guided underclassmen through course selection, putting together this [document](/assets/WhyCMPE.pdf) detailing my thoughts about my major.

In my free time, I like to play boardgames, bake, ski, and listen to musicals!
